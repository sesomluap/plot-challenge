For this assignment, we assembled and analyzed the results of a cancer drug trial with lab mice.
The study consisted of nine experimental drugs and one control group.
We summarized the results from all ten groups for comparison.
We created a number of visualizations ot help interpret the data.
The key visualization was the box and whisker plot that illustrated the effectiveness of Capomulin & Ramicane.
We then isolated the Capomulin group as well as a single moouse in that group.
The single mouse line chart illustrated the overall effectiveness of Capomulin.
The population scatter plot of the Capomulin group showed a clear positive correlation between mouse weight & tumor volume.
We then wrote a summary of our findings.

I primarily used in-class examples as guides for my code.
I worked with a study group of three other students for most of the assignment.
I also exchanged ideas with a couple other classmates one on one while we worked through.
My other main reference, was Stack Overflow and I debugged using ChatGPT.
